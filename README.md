# gpr_corrosion_ai
Experimenting with deep learning models to see the viability of detecting corrosion of rebar in reinforced concrete structures.
The model was made using pytorch <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/pytorch/pytorch-original.svg" width="15" height="15">.  This was a proof of concept done on small data - it will be able to infer on data from outside the original data files <not included> or training data provided.

Paths in the model to the data will need to be manually updated prior to running.

Models generally test around 60 - 85% with 1000 epochs.
