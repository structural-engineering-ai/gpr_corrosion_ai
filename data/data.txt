#  This is the radar data that had been clipped from 16 scans of a bridge deck - only one bridge. 
#  Files are numpy arrays that had been converted from .dtz radar files. The data ranges in shape from 
#  [512, 10] to [512,12] since it was manually cut from a larger radar .DTZ file. Data is in raw form 
#  and has not been normalized. Rebar in the "NG" file folder was clipped from larger scans and was 
#  designated as being corroded by field inspection. Rebar in the "OK" file folder was determined to 
#  be 'not corroded' by field inspection.

#  There are 279 samples in the OK folder, and 278 samples in the NG folder.
